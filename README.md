# Angular-with-TypeScript
Pluralsight Angular with TypeScript


[Deborah Kurata] Angular is GREAT for building client-side applications for the Web. But since Angular code is developed using JavaScript, Angular has all of the issues that come with coding in JavaScript: no strong data typing, global namespace issues, and lack of class-based object-oriented programming techniques. TypeScript solves these issues *and* makes it easier to build, refactor, and maintain your Angular applications! This course focuses on the basics of building an Angular application with TypeScript.
